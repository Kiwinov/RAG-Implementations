      "Trappist-1e is one of the seven Earth-sized planets orbiting the ultracool dwarf star Trappist-1, located about 39 light-years away from us. This exoplanet system was discovered in 2017 by a team of astronomers using the Transiting Planets and PlanetesImals Small Telescope (TRAPPIST) at the La Silla Observatory in Chile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trappist-1e is a particularly interesting world because it is thought to be a terrestrial planet, meaning it has a rocky composition similar to Earth. This makes it an intriguing candidate for hosting liquid water and potentially, life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some key facts about Trappist-1e:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Size:** Trappist-1e is roughly the same size as Earth, with a diameter of about 8,200 miles (13,100 km).\n",
      "2. **Mass:** Its mass is estimated to be around 0.9 times that of Earth.\n",
      "3. **Orbital period:** It takes Trappist-1e about 6.1 days to complete one orbit around its star.\n",
      "4. **Surface temperature:** The surface temperature of Trappist-1e is likely to be around -170°C to -100°C (-274°F to -148°F), making it a very cold world.\n",
      "5. **Atmosphere:** Scientists believe that Trappist-1e may have a thin atmosphere, but it's unclear whether this would be capable of supporting life.\n",
      "6. **Habitable zone:** Although Trappist-1e is not in the traditional habitable zone of its star (where liquid water could exist), some scientists propose that it might still be able to support liquid water on its surface due to tidal heating effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we don't have definitive proof of life on Trappist-1e, the discovery of this exoplanet has sparked significant interest in searching for biosignatures and potentially habitable conditions. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope are expected to provide further insights into this fascinating planetary system.\n",

Upon entering the apartment, she saw the figure of a young girl in Rahn's bed, and assumed the figure was Rahn. However, several hours later, she discovered that she was in fact Rahn's friend, who had fallen asleep in the bed. Her friend claimed to have last seen Rahn during the night when she got up to go to sleep on the couch.
